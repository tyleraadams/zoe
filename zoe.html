			<h1>Zoe Pearson</h1>
			<h3>PhD Candidate, Department of Geography, The Ohio State University</h4>
 
				<p><span class="first_letter">I</span> am a Ph.D. candidate in Geography (human-environment, feminist, political) at Ohio State University, with a completed graduate minor in Women&apos;s, Gender and Sexuality Studies.</p> <p>My scholarly interests include nature-society relations & political ecology, &ldquo;drug war&rdquo; geopolitics, feminist studies, socio-environmental justice, conservation & environmental change, and resource conflict in the Americas. </p>

				<p class="standalone">The two main research projects that I am currently pursuing look at how, in different ways, counter-narcotics politics impact people and the environment in Bolivia and Honduras.</p>

				<p>In 2010 I earned my MA at Ohio State in geography. I earned my BA in Geography at UCLA in 2005, with a minor in political science.</p>

				<p>When I&apos;m not working and the weather is good I spend as much time as I can outside, and enjoy walking & hiking, biking around town, and camping with friends. When the weather is bad I spend more time inside reading fiction, practicing yoga, and eating good food. Or I just travel home to California.</p>
